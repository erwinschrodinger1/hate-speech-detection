369. movie song lyrics
370. While a lot of young people maybe frustrated that their parents don’t understand, it’s usually in your best interest, at least the loving, kind yet strict types. 15 - 25 is the most crucial decade of your life. The choices you make in this decade will set course for as long as you are alive. Other decades are important too, but nothing sets life course and mindsets course for the rest of your life.

Think of this like a level in a video game, savaadhaani or samjdhaari ke saath cross karna padega. The actions, kind of friends relationships you make will be a huge part of your innner voice, so make good choices to have a positive inner voice

You may miss out on the fun..but after 1 or 2 year you may not remember the party and 10 years down the line you may not remember most people you thought will think you are not cool. That’s human memory over time it’s filters out unnecessary memories and people. Why do you think people romanticize songs and movies from 80s and 90snand call them good times, because their brains have erased the negative aspects of those times. Only once in a while it Amy come to mind.

So it’s not that about not understanding it’s about giving up something feel good but inconsequential, for something bigger and contibuting to the larger good. As a parent in 40s, I feel your pain, but parenting is tough choices, we struggle too trying to balance between keeping you happy yet drawing the line. Trust me your 30s and above will thank you for taking mature but hard decisions.

And yes the last part, our parents may make loving grandparents, but if they were your parents, you would never want that level of strictness.

103. Hi
104. 
1. 2:44 suddenly Ashneer appears and destroy his laugh was hilarious 
 
2. 2:44 that laughter amd then Ashneer's brutal truth bombing starts. 
3. 2:44 the way he laughed 
4. 2:44 Laugh Of Ravan
5. 2:39 that laugh was lit 
6. 02:44 my goodness that laugh was phenomenal 
7. Piyush told in Indiranagar, Bangalore sales happen more open store there. Being local proud to hear it. That how much our city is growing
8. 2:44 That laugh ended everything 
9. 2:44 that laugh was really unimaginable
10. Aquacolour will Be next contestant 
11. “2 lac ki sale mei neend kaise aa rahi hai aapko, nai aani chaiye aapko” ~ best line
12. Ashneer Is Real Business Man Maybe Bitter But He Spoke Always True and He Save Many Entrepreneur
13. I only gets lens kart ad on every shark tank vedio 
14. Ashneer
can't imagine Shark tank without this guy!
15. 2:43  hasde chehre da mtlb ye ni hota ki onna nu taklif ni hondi 
16. 6:45 This guy is seeking help I can say that he struggles a lot  he doesn't need money he just needs a good mentor who can help him to grow his dream business Good Luck bro keeps grinding 8:58 he again asks for help
17. Beard wale bande ko dekhkr hi lag rha tha ki banda bht dil se bnaya h product aur nhi chal pane ka gham aankhon me face expression se saaf saaf dikh rha tha 
️ God bless you brother. Keep hustling keep growing 
18. Ashneer : Nicha dikhao...taaki jazba hai to ache se business ko bada banaye...aur entrepreneurs me jazba hona xaiye
Anupam : Library of business....sab maalum hai...ache se bataega...sab kux maalum hai business k baareme...
Piyush : intellectual......bani huyi business pe hi paisa nhi lagata....tilent pe v banda paisa laga deta hai....he thinks about entrepreneurs future and their possible contribution to country.
Aman : Entertainer with suggestions....branding expert... marketing expert....plus CA
Namita : Me aapki business se connect nhi kar paa rahi. So for this reason I am out but best of luck 
19. Best reality show ever i seen in Indian Television. It's much better than Signing, drama & big boss. Youth may encourage seeing this. Well done Sharks
20. Maybe Piyush has given 1% equity to Sonyliv for lenskart ad in every shark tank video.
21. Ashneer is the best! His attitude and truthful nature is just something else 
️
22. 2:43 they way he laughed makes me anxious
23. 2:44 that laughter 
24. One of the step to start the great 'STARTUP ERA' is to start this show many other shows like it should be started to encourage people
25. anupam:-experienced business men
26. Anupam speeks outstanding 
27. Ashneer be like mudde pr aaty h sales ky 
Just amazing 
28. 2:45 the guy laugh after being looted
29. I have been using their shoes from 2014 and it's awesome till now.... the quality is way gud....
30. 2:43 Unwanted laugh....
31. Our next generation will  dream about becoming entrepreneur rather becoming SRK or Akshay Kumar. India is on the right pathway.
32. The moment Ashneer smile 
The guy in front understands he is in danger
33. 2:44 good laugh 
34. Golden words of Ashneer 05:30
35. 2:43 
Followed by ashneer shutting him up 
36. This show is an addiction 
️
37. I can see future throughout this show 
️🇮🇳
38. 0:06 ANUPAM MITTAL'S SIR PE RAKH LE YAAR WAS SPOT ON
39. Being a jain this kind of product should be there in the market . Appreciate them about their thoughts .
40. 2:48 
That fake laugh 
41. 1:48, that involuntary smirk by Namita
42. Piyush is such a sweet person
43. 2:44   Sala rakshas 
44. Leather is itself a brand every one wants original leather accessories. Ashneer's words are true
45. Product is different..
Not spend on marketing... 
R&D 3yr...
Rs. 5000/ 
Brand and product.. Is good.. 
Purpose driven product....
Yes need proper selling point
46. When Peyush said Indiranagar. He is on point 
️
47. Instead of making synthetic chemical shoes...to use the left over leather to make things is more eco firendly. It avoids creating more chemical waste.
48. He saying his company is branded, but we don't have sales ,we don't have any marketing. Normal people don't know our brand because  are overpriced. But we are top brand 
49. I love ashneer, on point with what he wants to know about business ........ the man is all business
50. when u get passed without studying 2:44
51. All the best to ethik team first , you have captured well...Vegan product is requirement of market. We also don't use leather product. Don't frustrate with sharks advices and conclusion. Slow & steady always wins the race. Sharks prediction couldn't be always right. They judge according to their believe systems, but before pitching hard words  sharks should be careful abt self respect of entrerprenur. Team ethik what happens with you, you are not funded will become a reasons for restructuring your pricing ,marketing and you will rock one day
52. Spitting facts seems really realistic
53. I swear ashneer can demotivate even Sandeep Maheshwari
54. Buddy keep trying. This business will grow surely. Many people has stopped purchasing leather.
55. 4:27

Finally shark tank pe aake marketing kar di 
56. Super inspiring to hear that their motivation was to transform a business into a brand. These guys are on a mission to change how the leather industry works.
57. Ashneer the most Intelligent and serious shark
58. Har ek video me ad hi ad 
Mai youtube pe video  dekhne thodi aaya hu 
Mai toh ad dekhne aaya hu 
59. 2:43 
Namita- Wo gana tha bluff master. Sabse bada rupaiyaa.

Ashneer - ek baat batao sale kitni karte ho. 
No bakwas straight on point.
60. Abhi ashneer ko khudko uski company se laat markar nikal diya
61. I am vegan ... And i understand what leather free / cruelty free means
62. Agreeing with Aman’s point that Millennials are definitely looking for sustainable alternatives these days. They have become responsible enough to avoid harming the environment to whatever extent possible.
63. 2:42 this is what you looking for! That laugh
64. The whole pitch is terribly sugar coated with values to market themselves to the target audience.

If they had been clear enough about their formula to attract a certain target market at a proper price point they would have nailed it. Instead they chose to portray themselves as some saintly company who wants to sell things at a premium.
65. Anubhav Singh Bassi's side business 
Apart from stand up comedy 
66. Loved how impressive and well-crafted their pitch was. The Ethik team is revolutionizing an industry that has been very cruel against the animals since a very long time.
67. 3:55 ashneer said "tum hare maa baap ne kuta nahi tum ko" was hilarious 
68. 2:43 
69. I wish, may the pitchers emerge very successful !
70. 2:44 that laugh 
71. These guys really needs to learn appreciate and at least motivate
72. What they concluded at the last was the only thing that is impressive about them
73. Lenskart add every episode 
74. Pankaj is so handsome 
75. 2:44 me laughing on my own jokes
76. It's always not about profit, no one even appreciated the cause of their business, going leather free is big thing in Indians lives. Most of us are vegetarian but we use animal skin in our wallets, shoes n belts. The look of the product looked great too
77. I have recently turned towards vegetarianism, and, I would love to buy leather free products.
 Only, if I could afford them.
78. 2:40
See his  face 
79. "waiting for a kind hearted person who can actually support me from the bottom of the heart"
80. 2:41  
81. Asneer is a true shark. Please like if you support him. Pray God for helping him always.
82. Anupam looks like Irfan Khan & Nawazuddin Siddique had a kid!
83. 2:44 his laugh
84. 2:42 sharks ke samne asa koun hasta hain bhai
85. They can save millions of animals
86. Aman gupta is true we have discounts in our blood in India you can't sell anything without discounts 
87. Shark tank US bhut phle se h aur ab aaya h Shark thank india ka bt koi n bhut mja aa rha h
 thank uh so much itna accha show launch krne ko
88. 2:55 is the best
89. Ashneer most used word is ' Dhanda'
90. Asneer in this pitch  was very  rude,instead  of guiding  them ,he is telling  them stop the business
91. 2:40 hasde chehre ka matlab yeh nahi hunda ki onha nu koi takleef nahi 
92. Non ecological product aur Ahimsa.... What a joke 
93. Bhai 450 ke shoes ko 4500 me bech raha hai kamaal hai.
94. My one of the favorite 
 TV show I watching all episodes
95. I.... love you Ashneer
96. 3:53 5:20 5:39 7:08 7:35 8:36
97. Bhai one lakh rupees sale per month itni to hamare yah thele pr pakodi wala kr deta hai infact isse jyada hi ... 
98. Ashneer ji mujhe bhi aise hi kuto taki mai bhi motivate ho jaun
99. Only legends know they advertised their products
100. Ashneer Grover Is A Real Shark 
101. 2:42 HEUEHUEUHEUHE
102. 2:44 that laugh
103. 02:43 
104. Came here to mention @2:44 but everyone has already made a mention
105. Finnally a new ad 
106. Asneer is best Shark.......
107. Ashneer always rock
108. 02:43
109. 2:44 Ashneer - Abhi tera doglapan utarta hu
110. Laugh
111. aquacolor vali laundiya dilvado 
️
112. Namita as usual 
113. Everything is temporary but Namita i am out in most of the deal is permanent 
114. 3:39 why is he laughing like that
115. Lenskart ki ad se episode start and end hua 
 aquacolor lenses ki so I'm  going to buy it.
116. 2:44 
click again and again on it.. this was hilarious 
117. 4:53
you came for here.
118. Panni ka juta 
 ️ that's funny
119. मैं सारे वीडियो यूट्यूब पे देख लुंगा लेकिन सोनी ऐप नहीं डाउनलोड करुंगा 
120. 5:30 ashneer starts
121. Lenskart ad aa rahi kya sabko bar bar?
122. Ashneer is the best
123. Bhai ye ashneer grover khudke upar fraud case chalra hai ,kitne confidence se gaali deta hai saala
124. When Aman asked about marketing and the guy laughed saying I haven't done any marketing mai baata rahu tab bhi utha ke bhar fake deta mai usko or uska brand ko
125. Piyush lenskart ki ads kitni hai har episode mein....
126. First time in the history of indian Shark tank i agree with ashneer , 11saal may 80lakh majak hai kya , itna too mutual fund de denge 7-8saal may , yar rubber shoo shop dal latay Jada kamatay
127. Kya peeyush bhai itna ad lenskart ka

136. 8:13 Bangalore Indiranagar road 
137. You have to show where are those enterprises and their position today after investment from sharks
138. Reality evryone waits for the decision of the best sharks
139. Boat ka product bhi kuch khas hain nahi. After sales warranty to local brand jaisa hain...
140. 2:44 
141. Strange nobody picked 2:44 laugh as a meme
142. Namita bs maze lene aati hai. Aur ek hi baat yaad krke rakhi hai pure season.
143. lenskart ka ad dekh raha tha bich me shark tank agaya
144. Aquacolor & lenskart are the best shows
145. Other sharks:- etc.
Le ashneer:- sidhi baat no bakwas.
146. College me Mera ek teacher mere jese average student ko bahut demotivate karta tha yeh uski personality bhi yeh Ashneer jesi hi thi
147. 9:54 Namita's 2.5kg expertised makeup and cheek pores... for people who had and have crush on her
148. Lenskart ki ads irritating hai
149. जैन ऐसे ही होते है, पर्यावरण की बजा देंगे लेकिन हिंसा नही करेंगे टाइप लॉजिक होते है इनके 
150. Peeyush be like ye aqua colour ka ad chalu  karo ya iam out
151. We indian need this type show.. 
Not like a dancing..
... Signing..
152. 9:51 aman Gupta truly and heartly speak...amazon aur Flipkart na hotay toh hum na hotay
153. Pro tip- if you don't want to see an advertisement on a video just close the video and open again repeat this till the advertisement doesn't play anymore

181. 100k/6k  ye bhai mahine ke 17 pair of shoes bech raha hai, 2 din me ek order aata hai, after spending thousands on ad everyday, some people like me prefer genuine leather shoes only, kyonki orginal to usi ko bolte hain, specific vegan leather ka market hi nahi hai, wo to synthetic leather, pu leather ke shoes 500-1000 ke waise hi aa rahe hain
182. Lenskart ka add dekhne aaye the bhul se shark tank dekhliya

195. 2:44 pe hasa to aisa hai jaise uske company ka IPO nikal gaya ho 
196. Fact is inn logo ko malum tha inko funding nahi milegi...Woh isiliye Shark Tank aye taki issi bahane inke brank ki free advertisement hojaye National Tv mai aur maximum audience tak pohoch jay
Master Stroke

Anupam : Library of business....sab maalum hai...ache se bataega...sab kux maalum hai business k baareme...
19. Best reality show ever i seen in Indian Television. It's much better than Signing, drama & big boss. Youth may encourage seeing this. Well done Sharks
20. Maybe Piyush has given 1% equity to Sonyliv for lenskart ad in every shark tank video.
21. Ashneer is the best! His attitude and truthful nature is just something else ️
22. 2:43 they way he laughed makes me anxious
23. 2:44 that laughter 
24. One of the step to start the great 'STARTUP ERA' is to start this show many other shows like it should be started to encourage people
25. anupam:-experienced business men
26. Anupam speeks outstanding 
27. Ashneer be like mudde pr aaty h sales ky 
Just amazing 
28. 2:45 the guy laugh after being looted
29. I have been using their shoes from 2014 and it's awesome till now.... the quality is way gud....
30. 2:43 Unwanted laugh....
31. Our next generation will  dream about becoming entrepreneur rather becoming SRK or Akshay Kumar. India is on the right pathway.
32. The moment Ashneer smile 
The guy in front understands he is in danger
33. 2:44 good laugh 
34. Golden words of Ashneer 05:30
35. 2:43 
Followed by ashneer shutting him up 
36. This show is an addiction ️
37. I can see future throughout this show ️🇮🇳
38. 0:06 ANUPAM MITTAL'S SIR PE RAKH LE YAAR WAS SPOT ON
39. Being a jain this kind of product should be there in the market . Appreciate them about their thoughts .
40. 2:48 
That fake laugh 
41. 1:48, that involuntary smirk by Namita
42. Piyush is such a sweet person
43. 2:44   Sala rakshas 
44. Leather is itself a brand every one wants original leather accessories. Ashneer's words are true
45. Product is different..
Not spend on marketing... 
R&D 3yr...
Rs. 5000/ 
46. When Peyush said Indiranagar. He is on point ️
47. Instead of making synthetic chemical shoes...to use the left over leather to make things is more eco firendly. It avoids creating more chemical waste.
48. He saying his company is branded, but we don't have sales ,we don't have any marketing. Normal people don't know our brand because  are overpriced. But we are top brand 
49. I love ashneer, on point with what he wants to know about business ........ the man is all business
50. when u get passed without studying 2:44
51. All the best to ethik team first , you have captured well...Vegan product is requirement of market. We also don't use leather product. Don't frustrate with sharks advices and conclusion. Slow & steady always wins the race. Sharks prediction couldn't be always right. They judge according to their believe systems, but before pitching hard words  sharks should be careful abt self respect of entrerprenur. Team ethik what happens with you, you are not funded will become a reasons for restructuring your pricing ,marketing and you will rock one day
52. Spitting facts seems really realistic
53. I swear ashneer can demotivate even Sandeep Maheshwari
54. Buddy keep trying. This business will grow surely. Many people has stopped purchasing leather.
55. 4:27

Finally shark tank pe aake marketing kar di 
56. Super inspiring to hear that their motivation was to transform a business into a brand. These guys are on a mission to change how the leather industry works.
57. Ashneer the most Intelligent and serious shark
58. Har ek video me ad hi ad

Namita- Wo gana tha bluff master. Sabse bada rupaiyaa.

Ashneer - ek baat batao sale kitni karte ho. 
60. Abhi ashneer ko khudko uski company se laat markar nikal diya
61. I am vegan ... And i understand what leather free / cruelty free means
62. Agreeing with Aman’s point that Millennials are definitely looking for sustainable alternatives these days. They have become responsible enough to avoid harming the environment to whatever extent possible.
63. 2:42 this is what you looking for! That laugh
64. The whole pitch is terribly sugar coated with values to market themselves to the target audience.

If they had been clear enough about their formula to attract a certain target market at a proper price point they would have nailed it. Instead they chose to portray themselves as some saintly company who wants to sell things at a premium.
65. Anubhav Singh Bassi's side business 
Apart from stand up comedy 
66. Loved how impressive and well-crafted their pitch was. The Ethik team is revolutionizing an industry that has been very cruel against the animals since a very long time.
67. 3:55 ashneer said "tum hare maa baap ne kuta nahi tum ko" was hilarious 
68. 2:43 
69. I wish, may the pitchers emerge very successful !
70. 2:44 that laugh 
71. These guys really needs to learn appreciate and at least motivate
72. What they concluded at the last was the only thing that is impressive about them
73. Lenskart add every episode 
74. Pankaj is so handsome 
75. 2:44 me laughing on my own jokes
76. It's always not about profit, no one even appreciated the cause of their business, going leather free is big thing in Indians lives. Most of us are vegetarian but we use animal skin in our wallets, shoes n belts. The look of the product looked great too
77. I have recently turned towards vegetarianism, and, I would love to buy leather free products.
 Only, if I could afford them.
78. 2:40
See his  face 
79. "waiting for a kind hearted person who can actually support me from the bottom of the heart"

88. 2:55 is the best
89. Ashneer most used word is ' Dhanda'
90. Asneer in this pitch  was very  rude,instead  of guiding  them ,he is telling  them stop the business
91. 2:40 hasde chehre ka matlab yeh nahi hunda ki onha nu koi takleef nahi 
92. Non ecological product aur Ahimsa.... What a joke 
93. Bhai 450 ke shoes ko 4500 me bech raha hai kamaal hai.
94. My one of the favorite  TV show I watching all episodes

142. Namita bs maze lene aati hai. Aur ek hi baat yaad krke rakhi hai pure season.
