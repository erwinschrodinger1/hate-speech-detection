If you don\u2019t know anything about this movie, you can think (as I did) that the action takes place in a Russian lager or concentration camp for raising the perfect SS-wifes (as they did in Germany, where young women were raised and educated to be good and obedient wives for the SS officers). The reality is not far from what I thought in the beginning.\"\n\nhttps://featherslive.wordpress.com/2020/05/29/level-16/", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/RadioMYC/posts/pfbid027MMnmgxQn6S7npHDCYmQvaeuZGoPf7e3mUFH6MYpCJxmZAS456XXW2YFjJ81jgVel"}, {"text": "I've just watched an interesting movie called Greta (2018) directed by Neil Jordan and starring my favorite actress, Isabelle Huppert.
