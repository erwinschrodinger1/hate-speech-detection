  "description": "Update: \nPart 2: https://youtu.be/OuZBA1RGSP8\n\nI try to recreate the festival finder like [https://www.totemlabs.xyz/ and](https://www.totemlabs.xyz/) https://www.crowdcompass.io/. This is part one of a series, where i try to rebuild it. \n\nIn this video I create the compass and point to the same direction all the time on the display. \n\nThe next video will add the GPS module.\n\nParts used in this video:\n\n- ESP32 Wroom 32 [https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005005561069566.html](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005005561069566.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2deu) 3.89\u20ac\n- QMC5883L [https://de.aliexpress.com/item/32834471779.html](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/32834471779.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2deu) 1.75\u20ac\n- 1.28\u201d TFT round display [https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006100703230.html](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006100703230.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2deu) 3.18\u20ac\n\nPlan for next steps\n\n- get the compass working\n- show the compass on the display\n- receive a gps signal and point the needle to a specific position hardcoded\n- send the gps position from one device to another using lora\n- send and receive back and forth with lora\n- pack everyting together in a box (lets see if i can do it, since i have no 3d printer yet)\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Intro\n01:31 Getting started and parts\n03:49 Ideation\n05:21 Compass\n06:28 Display\n07:08 Outro\n\n#festival #tracker #diy #esp32 #esp32project #coding #cpp #arduino",
